# Learning a communication channel

# This model shows how to include synaptic plasticity in Nengo models using the 
# hPES learning rule. Here we implement error-driven learning to learn to 
# compute a simple communication channel. This is done by using an error signal  
# provided by a neural ensemble to modulate the connection between two other 
# ensembles.

# The model has parameters as described in the book. Note that hPES learning 
# rule is built into Nengo 1.4 as mentioned in the book. The same rule can be 
# implemented in Nengo 2.0 by combining the PES and the BCM rule as shown in the
# code. Also, instead of using the 'gate' and 'switch' as described in the book,
# 'inhibit' population is used which serves the same purpose of turning off the 
# learning by inhibiting the error population. For computing the actual error 
# (which is required only for analysis), direct mode can be used by specifying 
# the neuron_type as 'nengo.Direct()' while creating the 'actual_error' ensemble.

# When you run the model, you will see that the 'post' population gradually 
# learns to compute the communication channel. In the model, you will inhibit 
# the error population after 15 seconds to turn off learning and you will see 
# that the 'post' population will still track the 'pre' population showing that 
# the model has actually learned the input.

# Press the play button to run the simulation.
# From the plots, you will see that the post population initially doesn't track 
# the pre population but eventually it learns the function (which is a 
# communication channel in this case) and starts tracking the post population. 
# After the error is inhibited (i.e., t>15s, shown by value zero in the error 
# plot), the post population continues to track the pre population. The 
# actual_error graph shows that there is significant error between the pre and 
# the post populations at the begining which eventually gets reduced to almost 
# zero as model learns the communication channel.

# The model can also learn other functions by using an appropriate error signal.
# For example to learn a square function, comment out the lines marked 
# 'Communication Channel' and uncomment the lines marked 'Square' in the code. 
# Run the model again and you will see that the model successfully learns the 
# square function.
